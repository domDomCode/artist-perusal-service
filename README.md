Hi

I have to admit, working with GraphQL is amazing! This was by far the most exposure I had to it, but can't wait to dig deeper into the subject.

The project is built with Yarn, and deployed on netlify: https://infallible-colden-39a2d0.netlify.app/

Hope you'll enjoy what's in the repo :)

Thanks!
